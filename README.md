# motorkit_rewound

A (hopefully) improved remake of the adafruit_motorkit crate

## Credit

I did not make the code this is based off of, all credit goes to ostrosco. the original version is [here](https://github.com/ostrosco/adafruit_motorkit).

This is simply my attempt at a remake, and fixing some issues that I had with their library
