# motorkit_rewound
A (hopefully) improved remake of the adafruit_motorkit crate

## **IMPORTANT**: a note to future users of the adafruit_motorkit raspberry pi hat

DO NOT BUY THE HAT IF YOU WANT TO USE IT FOR STEPPER MOTORS! it gives you zero ability to set the motor to run at a constant rate,
and you can only use it to move the motor one step at a time

IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY
